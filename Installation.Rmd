# Getting started

## What is Stan?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,}
knitr::include_graphics('images/general/Stan_logo.png', error = FALSE) 
```

[**Stan**](https://mc-stan.org) is an interface for several statistical software packages (e.g., RStudio, Python, Julia, Stata, and MATLAB) which allows the user to perform state-of-the-art statistical modelling within a Bayesian framework. For R users, the package is called `rstan` which interfaces Stan and RStudio.  

The focus will be solely on Stan and RStudio. We will show you how one can develop and compile Stan scripts for Bayesian inference through RStudio to perform basic parameter estimation, as well as a wide range of regression-based techniques starting with the simplest univariable linear models and its different families (logistic and Poisson) to the more advanced multivariable spatial risk models.

Before all that, let us install the appropriate software. The next section will guide you through the installation process.

## Installation of R & RStudio

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,}
knitr::include_graphics('images/general/RBase_RStudio_logo.png', error = FALSE) 
```

This section takes you through the installation process for [**R (Base)**](https://www.r-project.org) and [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com) on MAC and Windows.

2. Double-click the downloaded **rtools44-6335-6327.exe** file and follow the steps to complete the installation.

This completes the installation process for R and RStudio on Windows.

## Installation of `rstan` (or Stan)

When opening the RStudio application on your Windows or MAC PC. You will be greeted with its interface. The window is usual split into three panels: 1.) **R Console**, 2.) **Environments** and 3.) **Files, Help, Outputs etc.,**

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=TRUE,}
knitr::include_graphics('images/general/RStudio_Panels.png', error = FALSE) 
```

The above section is the **Menu Bar**. You can access other functions for saving, editing, and opening a new R and Stan script files for writing and compiling codes. Let us opening a new **R script** by clicking on the **File** **>** **New File** **>** **R Script**. This should open a new script file titled “**Untitled 1**”.

Now we are going to latest version of `rstan` 2.36.0.9000. Using the `install.packages()` function, we can finally install this package. You can use the code chunk below:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rstan", repos = c('https://stan-dev.r-universe.dev', getOption("repos")))
```

After installation, use the following code chunk to test if its work:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
example(stan_model, package = "rstan", run.dontrun = TRUE)
```

You will first see some gibberish running through your console - don't be alarmed - it means that its working. You will know `rstan` has been successfully installed, and working, when you see some iterations for four chains displayed in console. You will also see the objects `fit`, `fit2`, `mod` and `stancode` stored in the **Environments** panel when its done.

This completes the installation process for `rstan`.

## Installation of other relevant R-packages needed in GEOG0125

1. `sf`: “Simply Features” package that allows the user to load shapefiles into RStudio’s memory.
2. `tmap`: this package gives access to various functions for users to generate maps.
4. `stars`: this package for handling spatiotemporal arrays, raster and vector data cubes.
5. `SpatialEpi`: grants access to function `expected()` to calculated expected numbers.
6. `geostan`: grants access to further functions that we need to compute the adjacency matrix that can be handled in Stan. We will use the two functions `shape2mat()` and `prep_icar_data()` to create the adjacency matrix as nodes and edges.
7. `tidybayes`: grants access to further functions for managing posterior estimates. We will need it calculating the exceedance probabilities. Load this alongside `tidyverse` package.
8. `loo`: this package allows the user to perform model validation and comparison

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("sf")
install.packages("tmap")
install.packages("SpatialEpi")
