This module has been designed as an advanced topics module to learn data science concepts and methods, and to apply them in the domains of social science and geography. The module will introduce concepts such as Bayesian inference and Machine Learning methodologies. Description This particular facet in the advanced topics course aims to cover an Introduction to Bayesian Inference in RStudio using Stan, which is an interface to RStudio that allows state-of-the-art statistical modelling and Bayesian computation. We will introduce you to the absolute basics of writing your own probabilistic codes for carrying out a broad range of multivariable regression models within the Bayesian framework: Generalised Linear Modelling (GLMs); Hierarchical Models; and most notably for Spatial Risk Models; and Spatiotemporal Risk Models and Bayesian Updating for prediction in risk assessment and uncertainties with exceedance probabilities, which all have significant applications to many fields such as spatial epidemiology, social sciences, or disaster risk reduction and many more. All lecture notes, recommended reading and seminar learning materials as well as supplementary video content will be hosted on this webpage. You can download the lecture notes and data sets for the practical lesson from the table below.

It is a branch of statistics which applies probabilities to statistical problems. The core of Bayesian Statistics is the application of Bayes’ Theorem (or Bayes’ Rule) which uses conditional probabilities to quantify uncertainty outcome. We are going to show you how one can use Stan to encode probabilities to a statistical model (aka likelihood functions) to perform full Bayesian inference. 2.2.1 Learning outcomes Today’s session aims to introduce you to the basic Stan programming etiquette for Bayesian analysis in RStudio using Stan as an Interface, and producing output and interpreting it’s results. By the end of this session, you should be able to perform the following: Develop basic Stan code Know how to write and compile a Stan Program to compute the posterior distribution for simple parameters (i.e., mean, standard deviation, a proportion etc.,) Know how to interpret the results churned from a Stan HMC simulation run You can follow the live walkthrough demonstration delivered in the first 1-hour of the practical, and then use the remaining half to try the practical tutorials and follow the instructions on your own. 2.2.2 Demonstration recording (Length: 1:59:50 minutes) [Watch on YouTube] 2.2.3 Datasets &amp; setting up the work directory Since, this is our first practical lesson for GEOG0125, let us create a new folder GEOG0125 at the desktop location of our computer. Now, create a sub folder called “Week 1” within the GEOG0125 folder. Here, we will store all our R and Stan scripts. Set your work directory to Week 1’s folder. For Windows, the code for setting the work directory will be: setwd(&quot;C:/Users/AccountName/Desktop/GEOG0125/Week 1&quot;) For MAC, the code for setting the work directory will be: setwd(&quot;/Users/AccountName/Desktop/GEOG0125/Week 1&quot;) 2.2.4 Loading the appropriate packages Let us load the installed package called rstan. # Load the packages with library() library(&#39;rstan&#39;) Note that when you load rstan from cran you will see some recommendations on using multiple cores for speeding the process. For the best experience, we highly recommend using this code: options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()) rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE) This tells RStudio to use multiple core for parallel process whenever Stan is being implemented. Every time you want to use Stan - make sure to load parallel::detectCores() and rstan_options code. 2.3 Basic building blocks I: About Stan Programming The section describes how to code up a basic Stan model. This section forms the basis for later, and more complex models. 2.3.1 Opening a Stan Script in RStudio Alright, let’s open a Stan file. You can do this by clicking and selecting File &gt; New File &gt; Stan File When you open a new Stan file, you will be greeted with an untitled script which contains the following bits of code: // // This Stan program defines a simple model, with a // vector of values &#39;y&#39; modeled as normally distributed // with mean &#39;mu&#39; and standard deviation &#39;sigma&#39;. // // Learn more about model development with Stan at: // // http://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html // https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started // // The input data is a vector &#39;y&#39; of length &#39;N&#39;. data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; vector[N] y; } // The parameters accepted by the model. Our model // accepts two parameters &#39;mu&#39; and &#39;sigma&#39;. parameters { real mu; real&lt;lower=0&gt; sigma; } // The model to be estimated. We model the output // &#39;y&#39; to be normally distributed with mean &#39;mu&#39; // and standard deviation &#39;sigma&#39;. model { y ~ normal(mu, sigma); } Do not worry about that - it is just formalities by the developers behind rstan. You can delete everything you see in this script as we will build our own basic script from scratch. Once you have deleted the default information save the empty file in the Week 1 folder naming it Predicting a proportion.stan. Whenever you are saving Stan programme in RStudio always make sure to save it with a .stan ending. 2.3.2 Basic structure of a Stan script in RStudio A typical Stan program consist of the following 6 blocks: Data Transformed data Parameters Transformed parameters Model Generated quantities Out of these 6 blocks, the Data, Parameters and Model block must be specified. These are three compulsory blocks needed in any Stan script in order for a Bayesian model to work within the rstan environment. Let us define what these three important blocks are. FIRST: The data block allows the user to declare how the model reads the dataset from RStudio by specifying the sample size N or observations; the number of k parameters that needs to be estimated; the names or list of independent variables for the corresponding parameters (e.g., coefficients); as well as data constraints etc., A data block is specified accordingly as: data { } It is within these curly brackets will specify these details of our dataset. They must be precise as it will have to correspond with the data that is loaded in RStudio’s memory. SECOND: The parameters block allows the use to declare all primitive unknown quantities, including their respective storage types, dimensions, and constraints. The parameters that go here are the ones we want to infer or predict - e.g., includes the mean, variance, sd, coefficient and many more. A parameters block is specified after the data block: data { } parameters { } THIRD: The model block allows the use to declare and specify the sampling statements for the dependent variable (i.e., likelihood function) and parameters (i.e., priors) to be used in the model. A model block is specified after the parameters block: data { } parameters { } model { } Note that adding a double forward slashes // lets the user add a comment to script. Let add comments to the blocks: // Add comments after double forward slashes data { // data block } parameters { // parameters block } model { // model block } Important Notes: Since, the other blocks are not compulsory - we will leave them out for now. But we will come back and explain what those remaining blocks are in Week 2 and 3. Now, save your Stan script. 2.4 Basic building blocks II: Data types and constraint declarations In Stan, all parameters and data must be defined as variables with a specific type. Note, this quite a pain but going through this step allows rstan to perform really fast. There are four basic data types: int: for integers, used for specifying the sample size, and is applied to discrete variables real: for continuous, is applied to continuous variables (i.e., ratio or interval) vector: for a column vector of reals matrix: for a matrix of reals For constraints, we specify them on variables. For example, if we are dealing with a proportion p we will code it as real&lt;lower=0, upper=1&gt; p tells Stan that p can be any value from 0 to 1, inclusive. Note that specifying constraints really help speed Stan up so use them wherever possible. Lastly, you can create arrays of variables. For example, real p[10] tells Stan that p is an array of 10 real values. We can also create a matrix to represent a set of independent variables. Now that we have discussed these points - let work with an actual demonstration to show data types and constraints work. 2.5 Basic building blocks III: Developing our model PROBLEM: In 2021/2022, the GEOG0125 course, there was 13 students enrolled. It was Anwar’s first time being a teacher on the course, and hence was quite curious to know what proportion of students who will pass with a distinction (70%+). Since, he had no data on the pass rates. He had no prior knowledge. First, he assumes that the proportion of those passing with a distinction came from a Beta distribution that mimics a uniform Beta(1.0, 1.0). In term 3, after tedious marking of reports, he observes that 4 students (out of the total: 13) passed with flying colours. What is the posterior distribution of those getting a distinction for GEOG0125? Let us build our first model that predicts the posterior distribution of those passing GEOG0125 with a distinction. In this simple for modelling proportions (or prevalence), we extract our information: Total sample size is 13 (N) Number of students who passed (70% and above) is 4 (p) Data: Proportion (or prevalence) of distinction grades is 4/13, but this is just one instance (it could have been these other likely outcomes: 0/13, 1/13, 2/13, 3/13, 4/13, …, 12/13 or even 13/13). Let us represent proportion of distinction grades with some probability distribution \\(\\theta\\) which has a Binomial distribution (likelihood function). There is no prior knowledge, but we are dealing with a proportion here so a Beta distribution is best for this problem. We are assuming that it has uniform pattern i.e., Beta(1.0, 1.0) because all these instance (i.e., 0/13, 1/13, 2/13, 3/13, 4/13, …, 12/13 or even 13/13) have a equal chance of happening. This is an example of an uninformative prior We can code this information in Stan. FIRST: We specify the total number of student as integer int N which cannot be a negative number in the data block. Also, we also need to specify the number of students that passed as an integer int p which cannot be a negative number in the data block too. data { int&lt;lower = 0&gt; N; int&lt;lower = 0&gt; p; } SECOND: For the parameters block, here we will need to specify the name of the parameter that we want to infer. Here, its \\(\\theta\\) which is the proportion of those who got a distinction in GEOG0125. Note that \\(\\theta\\) follows a beta distribution and is therefore translated as a probability as a real value that is within the range of 0 to 1, inclusive. data { int&lt;lower = 0&gt; N; int&lt;lower = 0&gt; p; } parameters { real&lt;lower=0, upper=1&gt; theta; } THIRD: For the model block, here we will need to define our posterior distributions. Here, we need to state that p likelihood function is sampled from a binomial distribution as a function of N and \\(\\theta\\) (binomial(N, theta)). We also have to say \\(\\theta\\) is sampled from a beta distribution that is uniform. The model block will be: data { int&lt;lower = 0&gt; N; int&lt;lower = 0&gt; p; } parameters { real&lt;lower=0, upper=1&gt; theta; } model { p ~ binomial(N, theta); // our likelihood function or observation model theta ~ beta(1.0, 1.0); // our prior distribution alpha = 1 and beta = 1 } COMPLIMENTS: Well done, we have built our first Bayesian model. Let save it the script, what we need to do is compile and run it through RStudio to get our results. 2.6 Basic building blocks IV: Compiling our Stan code in RStudio Now, let us turn our attention to RStudio. The Stan script needs to be compiled from an R script. We will first need to create a list object using list() to connect the data to the information specified in the data before running the function stan() to the Bayesian model to get the results. The N and p will need to defined in the list object. # create list object and call it dataset dataset &lt;- list(N = 13, p = 4) Now, using the stan() to compile and obtain the posterior estimation of the proportions of students passing with a distinction: # the directory needs to be set to where you save the datasets and Stan script prediction.passes = stan(&quot;Predicting a proportion.stan&quot;, data=dataset, iter=3000, chains=3, verbose = FALSE) Some notes on the above code’s arguments: data= we are pushing the data we created from the list() to the Stan script. Stan is calling it. iter= we are asking the stan() to perform 3,000 iterations on each chain to generate the posterior samples. The chain can be a MCMC, NUTS or HMC algorithm (NUTS No-U-turn sampler is the default) chains= we are asking the stan() function to perform 3 chains (i.e., any of these algorithms can be stated in the function: i.e., MCMC, NUTS &amp; HMC) The resulting output can be printed with the function print(). Here, we are going to print the mean, standard error in mean, SD and the IQR ranges with 95% limits (i.e., 2.5% and 97.5%): print(prediction.passes, probs=c(0.025, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.975)) We obtain this summary table: Inference for Stan model: Predicting a proportion. 3 chains, each with iter=3000; warmup=1500; thin=1; post-warmup draws per chain=1500, total post-warmup draws=4500. mean se_mean sd 2.5% 25% 50% 75% 97.5% n_eff Rhat theta 0.33 0.00 0.12 0.12 0.24 0.32 0.41 0.58 1495 1 lp__ -10.08 0.02 0.73 -12.21 -10.26 -9.80 -9.61 -9.55 1879 1 Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Thu Jan 12 14:39:10 2023. For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size, and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat=1). What does it all mean? The top part states that 3 chains were run for 3000 iterations. However, the first 1500 samples generated from each chain were discarded as warm-up, meaning that only 1500 samples from each chain were kept, resulting 4500 (1500x3) total post-warm-up sample draws. The output shows the summary statistics for our \\(\\theta\\). The lp__ is the log-probability - which is used to quantify how well the model is for the data but, in my opinion, its not a useful estimate. Instead, use the effective sample size n_eff and Rhat. If the Rhat is less than 1.05 for All parameters - it means that the estimation of our parameters are fine. 2.7 Basic building blocks V: Extract posterior samples and interpretation At this point, let us extract the posterior samples and graph them to understand it posterior distribution. We use the extract() function from the rstan package, and graph them: # extracting the samples (it should be 4500) theta.pass_draws &lt;- extract(prediction.passes, &#39;theta&#39;)[[1]] # create a graph i.e., histogram hist(theta.pass_draws, xlim = c(0,0.8), ylim = c(0,800), main= &quot;Posterior samples&quot;, ylab = &quot;Posterior Density (Plausibility)&quot;, xlab = expression(paste(&quot;Pass rate &gt; 70%: &quot;, theta, &quot; [%]&quot;))) You can also plot the density as opposed to generating a histogram: plot(density(theta.pass_draws), main = &quot;&quot;, xlab = expression(paste(&quot;Pass rate &gt; 70%: &quot;, theta, &quot; [%]&quot;)), ylab = &quot;Posterior Density (Plausibility)&quot;) We want to compute the posterior mean, with the 0.025 and 0.975 quantiles (these limits are referred to as 95% credibility limits (95% CrI)). Here is how we compute them: # Calculating posterior mean (estimator) mean(theta.pass_draws) # Calculating posterior intervals quantile(theta.pass_draws, probs=c(0.025, 0.975)) Interpretation: The predicted proportion of students passing the GEOG0125 with 70%+ from our sample posterior distribution was 0.3305 (33.05%). This means that 33% is the most plausible pass rate. Our predictions, with 95% credibility, can be within the limits of 0.1239 and 0.5801. Formally writing as \\(\\theta\\) = 33.05% (95% CrI: 12.39-58.01%). We have predicted the most plausible value for pass rate. We can translate this into probability terms. For instance, by asking: “What is the probability that 33% of the students on GEOG0125 will pass with a distinction (70%+)?”. We can use this posterior distribution to make this estimation simply by calculating the mean our samples that is above 0.33. This is known as Exceedance Probability: # what is the probability observing a pass rate for distinction 70%+? mean(theta.pass_draws &gt;= 0.333) [1] 0.4824444 # # what is the probability observing a 33% pass rate for distinction 70%+? mean(theta.pass_draws &gt;= 0.50) [1] 0.09333333 Interpretation: The probability for observing a pass rate of 33% for distinction on GEOG0125 was 48%. It was less likely for half the number of students getting a distinction because the chance were 9.3%. 2.8 Basic building blocks VI: Updating our prediction with new information What about if I receive a new cohort of students in 2022/23. The excellent thing about Bayesian statistics is its ability to update results as new information or data comes - this technique is known as Bayesian Updating. This technique let’s you use the same script and self calibrates the new prior from the previous result. For instance, we predicted 0.3305 as the most plausible value for people to get a distinction. So the beta() specification will be Beta(5, 10) centred on 0.33 and not uniform. We can use past result and data, with the new information to fine tune the prediction, and watch as the results evolve. Let’s have a quick go at updating this prediction with new data. Let’s see: Total sample size is now 26 students in 2022/23 (N) This time around 9 scored a distinction (p) Let us represent the proportion of distinction grades with some probability distribution \\(\\theta\\) with a Binomial distribution (likelihood function) [Binomial(26, 9)]. - We have prior knowledge of last year’s proportion (0.3305) which has a Beta distribution [Beta(5, 10)] - this is our new informative prior - Let updates the codes: Updated dataset in our RScript dataset.updated &lt;- list(N=26, p=9) All we need to do is run the stan() function in R with out new dataset and the old model i.e., prediction.passes specified in the arguments. Obtaining updated posterior samples by compiling new Stan script prediction.passes.updated = stan(fit=prediction.passes, data=dataset.updated, iter=3000, chains=3, verbose = FALSE) print(prediction.passes.updated, probs=c(0.025, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 0.975)) Updated output summary table Inference for Stan model: anon_model. 3 chains, each with iter=3000; warmup=1500; thin=1; post-warmup draws per chain=1500, total post-warmup draws=4500. mean se_mean sd 2.5% 25% 50% 75% 97.5% n_eff Rhat theta 0.36 0.00 0.09 0.20 0.30 0.36 0.42 0.54 1734 1 lp__ -18.74 0.02 0.69 -20.61 -18.91 -18.48 -18.30 -18.25 2017 1 Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Fri Jan 17 10:21:26 2025. For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size, and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat=1).

Our predictions, with 95% credibility, can be within the limits of 0.2027 and 0.4935. We can formally write this as \\(\\theta\\) = 35.87% (95% CrI: 20.27-49.35%). 2.9 Tasks 2.9.1 Task 1 - Low-level arsenic poisoning in Cornwall, UK Try this first problem in Stan: Suppose, in a small survey, a random sample of 50 villagers from a large population in Cornwall were at risk of arsenic poisoning due to long-term low-level environmental exposure status were selected. Each person’s disease status (i.e., metallic toxicity) was recorded as either Diseased or None. 19 of the respondents have found to be diseased. The distribution of the prevalence is assumed to be of a Beta distribution with Beta(3,5). What is the predicted posterior prevalence of arsenic poisoning in Cornwall and its 95% Credibility intervals? 2.9.2 Task 2 - Body mass index (BMI) problem Try this second problem in Stan: The mean BMI value is 23 with SD of 1.2. Simulate sample of 1000 with BMI values based on this distribution N(23, 1.2) and perform Bayesian inference. What is the posterior mean BMI and its 95% Credibility intervals? Hints: In the R script, use the function rnorm() to generate your sample of 1000 BMI points In the R script, create a list() with N and bmi defined In the Stan script, define the data block in accordance to the list() object In the Stan script, the bmi values are measured outcome. Code this in the model block as a likelihood function using the norm(mu, sigma) notation In the Stan script, use the parameter block, and make sure to code your mu (mean) and sigma (standard deviation) as real (non-negative) numbers Note: Solutions for task 1 and 2 will be made available later today "],["bayesian-generalised-linear-models-glms.html", "3 Bayesian Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) 3.1 Lecture recording (Length: 1:00:02 minutes) 3.2 Introduction 3.3 Poisson Regression Modelling 3.4 Tasks", " 3 Bayesian Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) 3.1 Lecture recording (Length: 1:00:02 minutes) [Watch on YouTube] 3.2 Introduction This week we will learn how to perform Generalised Linear Regression Model (GLMs) within a Bayesian framework. We will use quantitative data focused on crime victimisation in Nigeria to examine how street accessibility measures such as distance, connectivity, choice and integration are associated with reported counts residential burglaries at a street level. The focus will be on Poisson-based regression models with both continuous and categorical independent variables. Let us begin. 3.2.1 Demonstration recording (Length: 1:59:49) [Watch on YouTube] 3.2.2 Datasets &amp; setting up the work directory Go to your folder GEOG0125 and create a sub folder called “Week 2” within the GEOG0125 folder. Here, we will store all our R &amp; Stan scripts as well as datasets. Set your work directory to Week 2’s folder. For Windows, the code for setting the work directory will be: setwd(&quot;C:/Users/AccountName/Desktop/GEOG0125/Week 2&quot;) For MAC, the code for setting the work directory will be: setwd(&quot;/Users/AccountName/Desktop/GEOG0125/Week 2&quot;) The dataset for this practical: Street Burglary Data in Nigeria.csv The datasets for the task at the end of the practical: Obesity and Fastfoods in MSOAs data.csv London LSOA 2015 data.csv 3.2.3 Loading and installing packages We will need to load the following packages for this practical: rstan: a package that enables R to interface with Stan. It provides R the functions to code, parse, compile, test, estimate, and analyze Bayesian models through Stan in R. loo: this package allows the user to perform model validation and comparison. MASS: Gives us access to glm.nb() to estimate the dispersion parameter for use in Bayesian model # Load the packages with library() library(&#39;rstan&#39;) library(&quot;loo&quot;) library(&quot;MASS&quot;) Note that when you load rstan from cran you will see some recommendations on using multiple cores for speeding the process. For the best experience, we highly recommend using this code: options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()) rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE) This tells RStudio to use multiple core for parallel process whenever Stan is being implemented. Every time you want to use Stan - make sure to load parallel::detectCores() and rstan_options code. 3.3 Poisson Regression Modelling We are going to fit a Poisson-type model on some an outcome that contain counts of households reporting to have been victims of burglary. Let us load the data into RStudio can call the object burglaryDataset. # Set your own directory using setwd() function # Load data into RStudio using read.csv(). The spreadsheet is stored in the object called &#39;burglaryData&#39; burglaryDataset &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Street Burglary Data in Nigeria.csv&quot;) names(burglaryDataset) 3.3.1 Selecting the appropriate Poisson model There are three different types of Poisson models: Standard Poisson regression Negative Binomial Poisson regression Zero-Inflated Poisson regression The implementation of one of these models are highly dependent on how the frequency distribution of the count response variable are displayed. If it resembles a normal curve - then use the standard version. Otherwise, use the Negative Binomial Poisson regression if there is any evidence of over-dispersion. When there is a an inflation of zero counts in the dataset, you will have to use the Zero-Inflated Poisson model to account for that problem. Let’s check the frequency distribution of the outcome variable burglary which corresponds to the number of reported instances a property on a street was burgled. You can simply use a histogram to examine its distribution: # see lowest count min(burglaryDataset$burglary) # see highest count max(burglaryDataset$burglary) # visual distribution hist(burglaryDataset$burglary, breaks=20, xlim = c(0, 25), ylim = c(0, 600), xlab = &quot;Report number of burglaries on a street segment&quot;, ylab = &quot;Frequency&quot;, main = &quot;Distribution of Burglary counts&quot;) The plot show evidence of over-dispersion. It indicates that streets in Kaduna have less frequency of burglaries. Here, we consider using a Negative Binomial Poisson regression model over the standard and zero-inflated versions (i.e., scenario 1 and 3). Now, that we know the model type, let us estimate the over-dispersion parameter using the glm.nb() function. # Fit negative binomial regression null model nb_model &lt;- glm.nb(burglary ~ 1, data = burglaryDataset) # Extract theta theta &lt;- nb_model$theta theta [1] 0.3161472 The estimated over-dispersion parameter is 0.3161472, which is small, this suggests that residential burglaries exhibits substantial over-dispersion. We will use this value in our Bayesian model when we code it in Stan. 3.3.2 Data preparation and set-up for Bayesian analysis in Stan Let begin with a model that only contains independent variables that are continuous measures i.e., distance and connectivity. We can prepare the dataset into list() object: stan_dataset_model1 &lt;- list(N = nrow(burglaryDataset), burg = burglaryDataset$burglary, dist = burglaryDataset$distance, conn = burglaryDataset$connectivity, offset = log(burglaryDataset$totalhouses), phi = 0.31614) Important Notes: The list object stan_dataset_model1 from RStudio is passed into the Stan. N = nrow(burglaryDataset) we are extracting the number of observations present in the dataset. Note that this a smart way instead of hard coding the number. Note that here, N is 743, meaning there 743 street segments. burg = burglaryDataset$burglary: Here, we defined the outcome variable (i.e., counts of burglaries) as burg. dist = burglaryDataset$distance: Independent variable for distance. conn = burglaryDataset$connectivity: Independent variable for connectivity. offset = log(burglaryDataset$totalhouses): Here, the offset is calculated from taking the log-transform of the totalhouses, which is the denominators used for expressing the residential burglaries as a crime rate per capita. phi = 0.31614: We specify the over-dispersion parameter as calculated from glm.nb(). Let’s create our Stan script for running a Negative Binomial Poisson regression within a Bayesian framework. 3.3.3 Creating a script to run a Negative Binomial Poisson regression in Stan A typical Stan program for a regression consist of the following 5 blocks: Data Parameters Model Generated quantities The Data, Parameters and Model block must be specified for the regression to work. But there will be additional block that we will need to transform the resultant parameters (i.e., coefficients) into relative risk (RR) inside the Generated quantities block. Let’s start with the data block: FIRST STEP: We specify the total number of observations N as an integer, as well as the information we defined in our list object stan_dataset_model1 to be passed to Stan. This information is specified in the data block: data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; // declare the overall number of data points to be passed into model int&lt;lower=0&gt; burg[N]; // define as an array and specify it as an integer for counts vector[N] dist; // continuous variable vector[N] conn; // continuous variable vector[N] offset; // offset variable for the denominators (total households on a stree segment) real&lt;lower=0&gt; phi; // fixed value to account for overdispersion in the crime counts } SECOND STEP: For the parameters block, here we will need to specify the name of the regression intercept alpha, which is baseline risk of residential burglaries, and the two coefficients i.e., beta[1] and beta[2] for our two independent variables dist and conn respectively. data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; // declare the overall number of data points to be passed into model int&lt;lower=0&gt; burg[N]; // define as an array and specify it as an integer for counts vector[N] dist; // continuous variable vector[N] conn; // continuous variable vector[N] offset; // offset variable for the denominators (total households on a stree segment) real&lt;lower=0&gt; phi; // fixed value to account for overdispersion in the crime counts } parameters { real alpha; vector[2] beta; } THIRD STEP: We build our likelihood function and specify the priors for each parameter under the model block. For all parameters - the priors have been centred around 0, meaning that broadly, these variables have no effect on residential burglaries, and if any, these effects may range from ±1 (so in risk terms 0.36 to 2.71). The regression model is neg_binomial_2_log(formula, Overdispersion): data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; // declare the overall number of data points to be passed into model int&lt;lower=0&gt; burg[N]; // define as an array and specify it as an integer for counts vector[N] dist; // continuous variable vector[N] conn; // continuous variable vector[N] offset; // offset variable for the denominators (total households on a stree segment) real&lt;lower=0&gt; phi; // fixed value to account for overdispersion in the crime counts } parameters { real alpha; vector[2] beta; } model { // prior specification for our parameters alpha ~ normal(0, 1); beta[1] ~ normal(0, 1); beta[2] ~ normal(0, 1); // likelihood function i.e., statistical model for (i in 1:N) { burg[i] ~ neg_binomial_2_log(alpha + beta[1]*dist[i] + beta[2]*conn[i] + offset[i], phi); } } LAST STEP: We instruct Stan to generated quantitites to calculate the relative risk ratio (RRs) by converting the estimated coefficients by using exp(). We ask it to calculate the log likelihood for model validation: data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; // declare the overall number of data points to be passed into model int&lt;lower=0&gt; burg[N]; // define as an array and specify it as an integer for counts vector[N] dist; // continuous variable vector[N] conn; // continuous variable vector[N] offset; // offset variable for the denominators (total households on a stree segment) real&lt;lower=0&gt; phi; // fixed value to account for overdispersion in the crime counts } parameters { real alpha; vector[2] beta; } model { // prior specification for our parameters alpha ~ normal(0, 1); beta[1] ~ normal(0, 1); beta[2] ~ normal(0, 1); // likelihood function i.e., statistical model for (i in 1:N) { burg[i] ~ neg_binomial_2_log(alpha + beta[1]*dist[i] + beta[2]*conn[i] + offset[i], phi); } } generated quantities { // report crime risk ratios real baselineCrimeRR; vector[2] CrimeRR; baselineCrimeRR = exp(alpha); CrimeRR = exp(beta); // model validation and comparison vector[N] log_lik; for (i in 1:N) { log_lik[i] = neg_binomial_2_log_lpmf(burg[i] | alpha + beta[1]*dist[i] + beta[2]*conn[i] + offset[i], phi); } } 3.3.4 Compiling our Stan code in RStudio and Results Now, let us turn our attention to RStudio. Using the stan() to compile and obtain the posterior estimation of the overall risk and crime risk ratios (CRR) for the each independent variable: # the directory needs to be set to where you saved the dataset and Stan script crr.negbin.model1 = stan(&quot;Week_2_Cont_Model.stan&quot;, data=stan_dataset_model1, iter=3000, chains=6, verbose = FALSE) We can print the results accordingly: # reports all results print(crr.negbin.model1, pars = c(&quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;beta&quot;, &quot;baselineCrimeRR&quot;, &quot;CrimeRR&quot;), probs = c(0.025, 0.975)) Output summary table Inference for Stan model: anon_model. 6 chains, each with iter=3000; warmup=1500; thin=1; post-warmup draws per chain=1500, total post-warmup draws=9000. mean se_mean sd 2.5% 97.5% n_eff Rhat alpha -2.16 0 0.13 -2.42 -1.91 3282 1 beta[1] 0.00 0 0.00 0.00 0.00 4237 1 beta[2] 0.06 0 0.02 0.02 0.11 3216 1 baselineCrimeRR 0.12 0 0.02 0.09 0.15 3225 1 CrimeRR[1] 1.00 0 0.00 1.00 1.00 4236 1 CrimeRR[2] 1.07 0 0.02 1.02 1.11 3215 1 Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Fri Jan 24 02:30:42 2025. For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size, and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat=1). Here is the messing part - interpretation. Before anything, note that alpha, beta[1] and beta[2] corresponds to the intercept, and coefficients for distance and connectivity, respectively. These are on the log-scale! The risk ratios from alpha, beta[1] and beta[2] which, in turn, corresponds to the intercept, and coefficients for distance and connectivity, respectively, are the baselineCrimeRR, CrimeRR[1] and CrimeRR[2]. For instance, the significant result is for connectivity, which shows for every unit increase in the number to street connections on a segment in the network, the risk of residential burglaries increase by 1.07 (7%), which is significant based on its 95% Credibility Interval (95 CrI: 1.02-1.11). We can compute exceedance probabilities i.e., that such risk concerning connectivity are greater than 1 (meaning there’s an excess risk): # Here, we can extract the simulated sample for CrimeRR[2] conn_draws &lt;- extract(crr.negbin.model1, &#39;CrimeRR[2]&#39;)[[1]] mean(conn_draws &gt; 1.00) [1] 0.9977778 This indicates a strong chance (99.7%) that streets with more connections to other street segments in the network will certainly increase the risk of residential burglaries. Lastly, we will assess the validity of our model using a test called Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation. The estimate from this test Expected Log Predictive Density (ELPD) quantifies how well a model performs and so higher values of ELPD indicates better predictive performance. While, it can be interpreted on its own, its primary value lies in model comparison rather than as an absolute measure. # extracting ELPD leave-one-out results from model with continuous variables only log_lik_with_cont &lt;- extract_log_lik(crr.negbin.model1, merge_chains = FALSE) r_eff_with_cont &lt;- relative_eff(log_lik_with_cont) loo_cont &lt;- loo(log_lik_with_cont, r_eff_with_cont, cores = 6) print(loo_cont) Computed from 9000 by 743 log-likelihood matrix.

All Pareto k estimates are good (k &lt; 0.7). See help(&#39;pareto-k-diagnostic&#39;) for details. We take note that the ELPD is -1022.1 3.3.5 Model with categorical variables The purpose of this section is to show: How to include categorical variables into the model Perform model comparisons Let’s include the following categorical variables: integq and choiceq into the regression. Each variable has four categories, we want to omit the first category as it represents the lowest exposure group, and use it a reference for the higher categories when we estimate their risk. # See table for categorical variables table(burglaryDataset$choiceq) table(burglaryDataset$integq) # Create dummy variables for choice burglaryDataset$choicecat2 &lt;- ifelse(burglaryDataset$choiceq == 2, 1, 0) burglaryDataset$choicecat3 &lt;- ifelse(burglaryDataset$choiceq == 3, 1, 0) burglaryDataset$choicecat4 &lt;- ifelse(burglaryDataset$choiceq == 4, 1, 0) # Create dummy variables for integration burglaryDataset$integ2 &lt;- ifelse(burglaryDataset$integq == 2, 1, 0) burglaryDataset$integ3 &lt;- ifelse(burglaryDataset$integq == 3, 1, 0) burglaryDataset$integ4 &lt;- ifelse(burglaryDataset$integq == 4, 1, 0) Let expand the model to include independent variables that are both continuous and categorical measures i.e., distance and connectivity, choice and integration, and the new information into a list() object: stan_dataset_model2 &lt;- list(N = nrow(burglaryDataset), burg = burglaryDataset$burglary, dist = burglaryDataset$distance, conn = burglaryDataset$connectivity, chcat2 = burglaryDataset$choicecat2, chcat3 = burglaryDataset$choicecat3, chcat4 = burglaryDataset$choicecat4, intcat2 = burglaryDataset$integ2, intcat3 = burglaryDataset$integ3, intcat4 = burglaryDataset$integ4, offset = log(burglaryDataset$totalhouses), phi = 0.31614) The amended Stan code will look something as follows: data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; // declare the overall number of data points to be passed into model int&lt;lower=0&gt; burg[N]; // define as an array and specify it as an integer for counts vector[N] dist; // continuous variable vector[N] conn; // continuous variable int&lt;lower=0, upper=1&gt; chcat2[N]; int&lt;lower=0, upper=1&gt; chcat3[N]; int&lt;lower=0, upper=1&gt; chcat4[N]; int&lt;lower=0, upper=1&gt; intcat2[N]; int&lt;lower=0, upper=1&gt; intcat3[N]; int&lt;lower=0, upper=1&gt; intcat4[N]; vector[N] offset; // offset variable for the denominators (total households on a stree segment) real&lt;lower=0&gt; phi; // fixed value to account for overdispersion in the crime counts } parameters { real alpha; vector[2] beta; vector[3] chcq; vector[3] intq; } model { // prior specification for our parameters alpha ~ normal(0, 1); beta ~ normal(0, 1); chcq ~ normal(0, 1); intq ~ normal(0, 1); // likelihood function i.e., statistical model for (i in 1:N) { burg[i] ~ neg_binomial_2_log(alpha + beta[1]*dist[i] + beta[2]*conn[i] + chcq[1]*chcat2[i] + chcq[2]*chcat3[i] + chcq[3]*chcat4[i] + intq[1]*intcat2[i] + intq[2]*intcat3[i] + intq[3]*intcat4[i] + offset[i], phi); } } generated quantities { // report crime risk ratios real baselineCrimeRR; vector[2] betaRR; vector[3] chcqRR; vector[3] intqRR; baselineCrimeRR = exp(alpha); betaRR = exp(beta); chcqRR = exp(chcq); intqRR = exp(intq); // model validation and comparison vector[N] log_lik; for (i in 1:N) { log_lik[i] = neg_binomial_2_log_lpmf(burg[i] | alpha + beta[1]*dist[i] + beta[2]*conn[i] + chcq[1]*chcat2[i] + chcq[2]*chcat3[i] + chcq[3]*chcat4[i] + intq[1]*intcat2[i] + intq[2]*intcat3[i] + intq[3]*intcat4[i] + offset[i], phi); } } We can use the stan() to compile the updated code to obtain the posterior estimation accordingly: # the directory needs to be set to where you saved the dataset and Stan script crr.negbin.model2 = stan(&quot;Week_2_Cat_Model.stan&quot;, data=stan_dataset_model2, iter=3000, chains=6, verbose = FALSE) We can print the results accordingly: # reports all results print(crr.negbin.model2, pars = c(&quot;baselineCrimeRR&quot;, &quot;betaRR&quot;, &quot;chcqRR&quot;, &quot;intqRR&quot;), probs = c(0.025, 0.975)) Output summary table Inference for Stan model: anon_model. 6 chains, each with iter=3000; warmup=1500; thin=1; post-warmup draws per chain=1500, total post-warmup draws=9000. mean se_mean sd 2.5% 97.5% n_eff Rhat baselineCrimeRR 0.13 0 0.03 0.09 0.20 4190 1 betaRR[1] 1.00 0 0.00 1.00 1.00 11128 1 betaRR[2] 1.08 0 0.03 1.03 1.14 5524 1 chcqRR[1] 0.95 0 0.21 0.60 1.44 4692 1 chcqRR[2] 0.94 0 0.23 0.57 1.46 4593 1 chcqRR[3] 0.86 0 0.29 0.44 1.55 4266 1 intqRR[1] 0.94 0 0.20 0.61 1.39 5311 1 intqRR[2] 0.84 0 0.18 0.54 1.25 5119 1 intqRR[3] 0.81 0 0.19 0.49 1.24 5302 1 Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Fri Jan 24 03:34:39 2025.

All Pareto k estimates are good (k &lt; 0.7). See help(&#39;pareto-k-diagnostic&#39;) for details. This first model’s ELPD was -1022.1, and full model’s show -1026.7. Based on this result, it is clear that the first model is better in terms of predictive performance since its ELPD is higher (i.e., -1022.1 vs -1026.7). So its best to stick with the first model, unless there is a strong theoretical reason to use second model (i.e., accounting for confounding). 3.4 Tasks 3.4.1 Task 1 - Obesity and Fastfoods in London Accessibility to junk food restaurants in young adolescents especially after school hours is a growing cause for concern. Especially, now that many young adults have a sedentary lifestyle; hence obesity rates among this population is increasing in the UK. Try this problem in Stan: Use the dataset Obesity and Fastfoods in MSOAs data.csv to determine the links between prevalence of obesity in high school students and density of fast food (cheap) restaurant and deprivation in MSOAs in London. Implement a Bayesian GLM using Stan code. Variable names: SEQID: ID number for row MSOA11CD: Unique identifier for MSOA area MSOA11NM: Name of the MSOA area OBESE: Number of child identified as obese in MSOA in London TOTAL: Total number of children surveyed for BMI measurements IMDMSOA: Area-level socioeconomic deprivation score (higher scores means higher deprivation and vice versa) RESTCAT: Categorical variable for classifying an MSOA in terms of density of junk/cheap fast food outlets restaurants: 1 = 1 to 10, 2= 11 to 25, 3= 26 to 50 and 4= 51 to 300. HINT: You might want to consider using the following functions: binomial_logit() or binomial() in the model block and reporting the odd ratios using the generated quantities block. You might want to consider computing the exceedance probabilities for the odd ratios using the threshold of 1. 3.4.2 Task 2 - Factors affecting house prices in London (2015) Try this problem in Stan: Use London LSOA 2015 data.csv data pertained house prices in 2015, and assess it’s relationship with public transport accessibility (PTA), average income and socioeconomic deprivation (IMD) as the independent variables. Implement a Bayesian GLM using Stan code. Variables names: LSOACODE: Unique identification code for the geographic area AVEPRICE: (Dependent variable) Average house price estimated for the LSOA in 2015 AVEINCOME: Estimated average annual income for households within an LSOA in 2015 IMDSCORE: Deprivation score for an LSOA in 2015 PTAINDEX: Measures levels of access/connectivity to public transport HINT: You might want to consider using the following functions: normal() in the model block.

These models are useful and much superior to the generic regressions especially if there is an hierarchical structure to the data. This artefact must be taken into account off to ensure statistical robustness. We will focus on implementing 2-level hierarchical regressions with an example using a model that has a varying intercept and varying-slope coefficients. These models are quite simple to pull off in Stan once you get the gist of it. Alright, let us begin! 4.2.1 Demonstration recording (Length: 1:50:34) [Watch on YouTube] 4.2.2 Datasets &amp; setting up the work directory Go to your folder GEOG0125 and create a sub folder called “Week 3” within the GEOG0125 folder. Here, we will store all our R &amp; Stan scripts as well as datasets. Set your work directory to Week 3’s folder. For Windows, the code for setting the work directory will be: setwd(&quot;C:/Users/AccountName/Desktop/GEOG0125/Week 3&quot;) For MAC, the code for setting the work directory will be: setwd(&quot;/Users/AccountName/Desktop/GEOG0125/Week 3&quot;) The main dataset for this practical: WHO-AFRO Cholera 2000-17.csv The dataset for the task: Pregnancies and hospital data.csv Let us load this dataset into memory: # load up the data WHO_AFRO_Cholera &lt;- read.csv(&quot;WHO-AFRO Cholera 2000-17.csv&quot;) 4.2.3 Loading packages We need to load the installed packages including rstan and tidybayes: # load up packages library(&quot;rstan&quot;) library(&#39;tidybayes&#39;) library(&#39;tidyverse&#39;) Configure Stan: options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()) rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE) 4.3 Data preparation and set-up for Bayesian analysis in Stan We are going to fit a 2-level Hierarchical regression model on a count outcome i.e., Cholera and to see the impact of the following risk factors: coverage of no basic water services and no sanitation services. The WHO_AFRO_Cholera object contains a total of 13 sub-Saharan African countries who are part of the World Health Organization, whereby each country has cholera, basic water and sanitation service information starting from 2000, and up to 2017, inclusive (i.e., 18 years worth of data). Other independent variables for the countries for each year includes GDP, Temperature and Rainfall. Note that the yearly data are grouped within the 13 countries country_id or country_name. Within a country, the information has a unique reading captured by the year_id. We want fit a 2-level negative binomial Poisson regression model with varying-intercept and varying-slopes on the basic water and sanitation services variables. To explore: Global relationships between the increased burden of limited water and basic sanitation services, and risk of cholera, across the WHO-AFRO. Local relationships between the increased burden of limited water and basic sanitation services, and risk of cholera, within each country. To perform such 2-level hierarchical model, we need to prepare the dataset in RStudio accordingly by extracting the right pieces of information from the WHO_AFRO_Cholera data frame object to be passed to the data block in our Stan script. KEY INGREDIENTS: N: total number of observations/rows in our dataset (234); Country: maximum number of groups formed in the dataset (13 countries); CountryID: this lists all the unique ID numbers for the group i.e., aligns country ID with the observations; Cholera: we want to extract this as a dependent variable and treat as an int because its counts measure; Water: we want to extract this as a primary independent variable and treat as an real since its a continuous measure; Sanitation: we want to extract the primary independent variable and treat as a real since its a continuous measure; GDP: we want to include this as an apriori independent variable and treat as an real since its a continuous measure; Rainfall: we want to include this as another apriori independent variable and treat as an real since its a continuous measure; Temperature: we want to include this as another apriori independent variable, just like the first two, and treat as an real since its a continuous measure; Log_Population: The population column has been log-transformed in the list(). This is going to be treated as an offset real measure; Overdispersion_parameter: We are going to set this at 0.4. However, we create a distribution around this value where the degree of over-dispersion can range from 0 to 0.4 using a cauchy(0, 0.4). This means that the counts in cholera can potentially have a shape that is extremely over-dispersed (0) to somewhere that’s mildly over-dispersed patterns (up-to 0.4). We can condense this information into list() object in line of code as our dataset for Stan to compile: # create dataset for Stan stan.cholera.dataset &lt;- list( N=nrow(WHO_AFRO_Cholera), Country=max(unique(WHO_AFRO_Cholera$country_id)), CountryID=as.integer(WHO_AFRO_Cholera$country_id), Cholera=WHO_AFRO_Cholera$cholera, Log_Population = log(WHO_AFRO_Cholera$population), Water = WHO_AFRO_Cholera$basic_water, Sanitation = WHO_AFRO_Cholera$basic_sanitation, GDP = WHO_AFRO_Cholera$gdp, Rainfall = WHO_AFRO_Cholera$rainfall, Temperature = WHO_AFRO_Cholera$temperature, Overdispersion_Parameter = 0.4 ) At this point, the dataset is now fully prepared and ready to go. Let’s create our Stan script for running a 2-level negative binomial Poisson regression within a Bayesian framework. 4.3.1 Creating a script to run a 2-level Multilevel linear regression in Stan We will need data, parameters, transformed parameters and model blocks for this analysis. FIRST STEP: In the data block, we can pass the key information from our list object stan.cholera.dataset. data { int&lt;lower=1&gt; N; // Number of observations int&lt;lower=1&gt; Country; // Number of countries int&lt;lower=1, upper=Country&gt; CountryID[N]; // Country IDs int&lt;lower=0&gt; Cholera[N]; // Cholera cases real Water[N]; // Water access variable real Sanitation[N]; // Sanitation variable real GDP[N]; // GDP variable real Rainfall[N]; // Rainfall variable real Temperature[N]; // Temperature variable real Log_Population[N]; // Logged Population variable used as offset real Overdispersion_Parameter; // Over-dispersion prior (set to 0.4) } SECOND STEP: For the parameters block, here we will need to specify the name of the fixed effect of the regression model i.e., gamma00, gamma01 and gamma02, which is the overall intercept, and the overall effect (coefficients) of Water and Sanitation on Cholera, respectively. These are operating on the level-1 part of the model. We want the intercept and latter coefficients vary across the countries at level-2; thus, we define country-specific random effects from them which is governed by some standard deviation i.e., their variation within countries. Note that the coefficients beta3, beta4 and beta5 for GDP, Rainfall and Temperature are on level-1. Lastly, we are defining phi to capture all the possible shapes &amp; ways which the distribution in Cholera can be over-dispersed. Here is the code: data { int&lt;lower=1&gt; N; // Number of observations int&lt;lower=1&gt; Country; // Number of countries int&lt;lower=1, upper=Country&gt; CountryID[N]; // Country IDs int&lt;lower=0&gt; Cholera[N]; // Cholera cases real Water[N]; // Water access variable real Sanitation[N]; // Sanitation variable real GDP[N]; // GDP variable real Rainfall[N]; // Rainfall variable real Temperature[N]; // Temperature variable real Log_Population[N]; // Logged Population variable used as offset real Overdispersion_Parameter; // Over-dispersion set to 0.4 as the initiate value } parameters { real gamma00; // Overall intercept real gamma01; // Overall effect of Water real gamma02; // Overall effect of Sanitation real beta3; // overall fixed effects relationship with GDP real beta4; // overall fixed effects relationship with rainfall real beta5; // overall fixed effects relationship with temperature real random_intercept[Country]; // Country-specific random intercepts real random_slope_water[Country]; // Country-specific random slopes for Water real random_slope_sanitation[Country]; // Country-specific random slopes for Sanitation real&lt;lower=0&gt; group_intercept_sd; // SD of random intercepts real&lt;lower=0&gt; group_slope_water_sd; // SD of random slopes for Water real&lt;lower=0&gt; group_slope_sanitation_sd; // SD of random slopes for Sanitation real&lt;lower=0&gt; phi; // Use phi to create a distribution around the Overdispersion_Parameter THIRD STEP: For the transformed parameters block, include the sub-equations for beta00, beta01 and beta02, where we add the fixed effects and random effects: data { int&lt;lower=1&gt; N; // Number of observations int&lt;lower=1&gt; Country; // Number of countries int&lt;lower=1, upper=Country&gt; CountryID[N]; // Country IDs int&lt;lower=0&gt; Cholera[N]; // Cholera cases real Water[N]; // Water access variable real Sanitation[N]; // Sanitation variable real GDP[N]; // GDP variable real Rainfall[N]; // Rainfall variable real Temperature[N]; // Temperature variable real Log_Population[N]; // Logged Population variable used as offset real Overdispersion_Parameter; // Over-dispersion set to 0.4 as the initiate value } parameters { real gamma00; // Overall intercept real gamma01; // Overall effect of Water real gamma02; // Overall effect of Sanitation real beta3; // overall fixed effects relationship with GDP real beta4; // overall fixed effects relationship with rainfall real beta5; // overall fixed effects relationship with temperature real random_intercept[Country]; // Country-specific random intercepts real random_slope_water[Country]; // Country-specific random slopes for Water real random_slope_sanitation[Country]; // Country-specific random slopes for Sanitation real&lt;lower=0&gt; group_intercept_sd; // SD of random intercepts real&lt;lower=0&gt; group_slope_water_sd; // SD of random slopes for Water real&lt;lower=0&gt; group_slope_sanitation_sd; // SD of random slopes for Sanitation real&lt;lower=0&gt; phi; // Use phi to create a distribution around the Overdispersion_Parameter } transformed parameters { real beta00[Country]; real beta01[Country]; real beta02[Country]; for (j in 1:Country) { beta00[j] = gamma00 + random_intercept[j]; // Random intercept per country - overall risks of cholera varying by country beta01[j] = gamma01 + random_slope_water[j]; // Random slope for Water - overall risks cholera with `Water` varying by country beta02[j] = gamma02 + random_slope_sanitation[j]; // Random slope for Sanitation - overall risks cholera with `Sanitation` varying by country } } FOURTH STEP: We build our likelihood function and specify the priors for each parameter under the model block. This will contain our statistical model. data { int&lt;lower=1&gt; N; // Number of observations int&lt;lower=1&gt; Country; // Number of countries int&lt;lower=1, upper=Country&gt; CountryID[N]; // Country IDs int&lt;lower=0&gt;

Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Fri Jan 31 04:58:31 2025. For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size, and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat=1). Dealing with results from Stan can be very challenging. Let us show you how to extract the desired results. We will first report the overall relative risks and group variations: # print table to reports the relative risk ratios for Cholera print(bayesian.hierarchical.model, probs=c(0.025, 0.975), pars = c(&quot;gamma00_RR&quot;, &quot;gamma01_RR&quot;, &quot;gamma02_RR&quot;, &quot;beta3_RR&quot;, &quot;beta4_RR&quot;, &quot;beta5_RR&quot;, &quot;group_intercept_sd&quot;, &quot;group_slope_water_sd&quot;, &quot;group_slope_sanitation_sd&quot;)) Inference for Stan model: anon_model. 6 chains, each with iter=40000; warmup=20000; thin=1; post-warmup draws per chain=20000, total post-warmup draws=120000. mean se_mean sd 2.5% 97.5% n_eff Rhat gamma00_RR 0.94 0 1.16 0.09 3.89 80907 1 gamma01_RR 1.89 0 0.58 0.93 3.22 55395 1 gamma02_RR 1.64 0 0.77 0.67 3.59 33647 1 beta3_RR 1.33 0 0.27 0.86 1.93 33575 1 beta4_RR 0.99 0 0.01 0.98 1.00 64589 1 beta5_RR 0.74 0 0.03 0.68 0.81 70905 1 group_intercept_sd 0.28 0 0.24 0.01 0.90 4267 1 group_slope_water_sd 0.57 0 0.40 0.04 1.52 6965 1 group_slope_sanitation_sd 1.33 0 0.47 0.54 2.40 24038 1 Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Fri Jan 31 04:58:31 2025. For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size, and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat=1). Here is the interpretation: gamma00 is the overall baseline risk of cholera in sub-Saharan Africa. It is 0.94 (95% CrI from 0.09 to 3.89) times lower than usual in the population. gamma01 is the overall risk of cholera associated with coverage without basic water services in sub-Saharan Africa. The risk of cholera is 1.89 (95% CrI: 0.93 to 3.22) times higher when coverage without such service gets higher. gamma02 is the overall risk of cholera associated with coverage without basic sanitation services in sub-Saharan Africa. The risk of cholera is 1.64 (95% CrI: 0.67 to 3.59) times higher when coverage without such service gets higher. group_intercept_sd: The standard deviation is 0.28 - this is the random intercepts across countries, which suggests that WHO-AFRO countries have somewhat low variability in their baseline cholera rates. This can be interpreted as countries don’t differ drastically in baseline cholera risk (this can be eyeballed from the non-exponentiated values from beta00[1], beta00[2] to beta00[13]). group_slope_water_sd: The standard deviation is 0.57 - this is the random slope for the water service, which suggests that its effect on cholera risk somewhat varies considerably across the countries and not stable unlike the baseline risk (0.57 vs. 0.28)(- this variation can be eyeballed from the exponentiated values of beta01_RR[1] to beta01_RR[13]). group_slope_santitation_sd: The standard deviation is 1.33 - this is the random slope for the sanitation services, which suggests that its effect on cholera risk substantially varies across the countries, more so than the intercept and water (- this variation can be eyeballed from the exponentiated values of beta02_RR[1] to beta02_RR[13]).

Let us use an example for gha_w which refers to the estimate random slope for limited water services and it effect on cholera risk in Ghana. The risk in relation to this variable is 1.49 (95% CrI: 0.42 to 3.11) times higher. Such chance of risk being greater than 1 in relation to this variable is 0.73 (73%). This result; however, is not significant. 4.4 Task Try your hand on this problem in Stan: Build a random intercept logit model using data on 1060 births to 501 mothers. The outcome of interest is whether the birth was delivered in a hospital or elsewhere. The predictors include the log of income loginc, the distance to the nearest hospital distance, and two indicators of mothers’s education: dropout for less than high school and college for college graduate, so high school or some college is the reference cell. Have ago at building this model.

This a powerful tool used often in many applications e.g., spatial epidemiology, disaster risk reduction and environmental criminology and many more. This exercise will focus on casualty data resulting from road accidents by car users (and/or occupants) in the UK. Road traffic accidents &amp; injuries are a serious problem worldwide. In fact, it is one of the leading causes of death attributed to significant life-years lost and as a consequence is associated with considerable economic losses to impacted individuals and families. There are many individual, environmental and geographical risk factors for road-related casualties. Here, we will use a series of spatial models from a Bayesian framework to estimate the area-specific relative risks (RR) of casualties due to road accidents in local authority areas across the England; and we will quantify the levels of uncertainty using a device called exceedance probabilities. 5.2 Learning outcomes You will learn how to: Implement the Spatial intrinsic conditional autoregressive model (ICAR) to areal data in RStan; How to use the ICAR model to predict the area-specific relative risks (RR) for areal units and how to determine whether the levels of such risk are statistically significant or not through 95% credible intervals (95% CrI); How to determine the Exceedance Probability i.e., the probability that an area has an excess risk of an outcome that exceeds a given risk threshold (e.g., RR &gt; 1 (null value)); 5.2.1 Loading and installing packages We will need to install the following new packages: SpatialEpi: grants access to function expected() to calculated expected numbers tidybayes: grants access to further functions for managing posterior estimates. We will need it calculating the exceedance probabilities. Load this alongside tidyverse package geostan: grants access to further functions that we need to compute the adjacency matrix that can be handled in Stan. We will use the two functions shape2mat() and prep_icar_data() to create the adjacency matrix as nodes and edges. install.packages(&quot;geostan&quot;) install.packages(&quot;SpatialEpi&quot;) install.packages(&quot;tidybayes&quot;) Now, lets load all packages need specifically for this computer practical: # Load the packages with library() library(&quot;sf&quot;) library(&quot;tmap&quot;) library(&quot;spdep&quot;) library(&quot;rstan&quot;) library(&quot;geostan&quot;) library(&quot;SpatialEpi&quot;) library(&quot;tidybayes&quot;) library(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) Upon loading the rstan package, we highly recommend using this code to configure it with RStudio: options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()) rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE) This tells RStudio to use the multiple cores in your computer for parallel processing whenever Stan is being implemented. Every time you want to use Stan - make sure to load parallel::detectCores() and rstan_options code. 5.2.2 Datasets &amp; setting up the work directory Go to your folder GEOG0125 and create a sub folder called “Week 4” within the GEOG0125 folder. Here, we will store all our R &amp; Stan scripts as well as datasets. Set your work directory to Week 4’s folder. For Windows, the code for setting the work directory will be: setwd(&quot;C:/Users/AccountName/Desktop/GEOG0125/Week 4&quot;) For MAC, the code for setting the work directory will be: setwd(&quot;/Users/AccountName/Desktop/GEOG0125/Week 4&quot;) The dataset for this practical are: Road Casualties Data 2015-2020.csv England Local Authority Shapefile.shp England Regions Shapefile.shp The dataset were going to start of with is the Road Casualties Data 2015-2020.csv. This data file contains the following information: It contains the 307 local authority areas that operate in England. The names and codes are defined under the columns LAD21NM and LAD21CD respectively; It contains the following variables: Population, Casualties and IMDScore. The Casualties is the dependent variable, and IMDScore is the independent variable. We will need Population column to derive the expected number of road casualties to be used as an offset in the Bayesian model. The shapefile England Local Authority Shapefile.shp contains the boundaries for all 307 local authorities in England. The England Regions Shapefile.shp contains the boundaries for all 10 regions that make up England. Let us load these dataset to memory: # load the shape files england_LA_shp &lt;- read_sf(&quot;England Local Authority Shapefile.shp&quot;) england_Region_shp &lt;- read_sf(&quot;England Regions Shapefile.shp&quot;) # load in the cross-sectional road accident dataset road_accidents &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Road Casualties Data 2015-2020.csv&quot;) 5.3 Data preparation in RStudio 5.3.1 Calculation for expected numbers In order to estimate the risk of casualties due to road accidents at an LA-level in England, we will need to first obtain a column that contains estimates from expected number of road casualties. This is derived from the Population column which as denominators or reference population size which is multiplied to the overall incidence rates of road accidents to get the number of expected casualties for each LA area. You can use the expected() function to compute this column into the road_accident data frame # calculate the expected number of cases road_accidents$ExpectedNum &lt;- round(expected(population = road_accidents$Population, cases = road_accidents$Casualties, n.strata = 1), 0) This particular column ExpectedNum is important, it must be computed and used as an offset in our spatial model. 5.3.2 Converting the spatial adjacency matrix to nodes &amp; edges We will need to transform the image below into a list of nodes and edges accordingly as Stan can only identify adjacency with a set of paired nodes with edges that connect them. For instance, node1 is the index region and node2 is the list of neighbouring regions connected to the index region in node1 We can perform this by first merging in the road accident data to the LA-level shapefile. Once this action is completed, we will then need to coerce the spatial object to be from a simple features (i.e., sf) object to the spatial object (i.e., sp). Here is the code: # merge the attribute table to the shapefile spatial.data &lt;- merge(england_LA_shp, road_accidents, by.x = c(&quot;LAD21CD&quot;, &quot;LAD21NM&quot;), by.y = c(&quot;LAD21CD&quot;, &quot;LAD21NM&quot;), all.x = TRUE) # reordering the columns spatial.data &lt;- spatial.data[, c(3,1,2,4,5,7,6)] # need to be coerced into a spatial object sp.object &lt;- as(spatial.data, &quot;Spatial&quot;) Now, we are going to need the nodes and edges from the sp.object using the shape2mat() function - this changes it into a matrix object. From the matrix object, we will be able to prepare the data from spatial ICAR model using the prep_icar_data() function. Here, is the code: # needs to be coerced into a matrix object adjacencyMatrix &lt;- shape2mat(sp.object) # we extract the components for the ICAR model extractComponents &lt;- prep_icar_data(adjacencyMatrix) From the extractComponents object, we will need to extract the following contents: $group_size this is the number of areal units under observation listed in the shapefile (should be the same in the road accidents dataset) $node1 are index regions of interest $node2 are the other neighbouring regions that are connected to the index region of interest listed in node1 $n_edges creates the network as show area is connected to what neighbourhood. It’s still an adjacency matrix using the queen contiguity matrix but as a network. Here is the code for performing the extraction: n &lt;- as.numeric(extractComponents$group_size) nod1 &lt;- extractComponents$node1 nod2 &lt;- extractComponents$node2 n_edges &lt;- as.numeric(extractComponents$n_edges) Note that the information needed are stored in n, nod1, nod2 and n_edges. 5.3.3 Create the dataset to be compiled in Stan For the list step in the data preparation, we need to define the variables needed to be compiled in Stan. The outcome Casualties, independent variable IMDScore and offset variable ExpectedNum needs to be extracted into separate vectors. The data needs to be aligned with the areas in shapefile as the result will be churned to that order. So make sure the data is already linked in to the geometries! Here is the code: y &lt;- spatial.data$Casualties x &lt;- spatial.data$IMDScore e &lt;- spatial.data$ExpectedNum Now, we create our dataset for Stan: # put all components into a list object stan.spatial.dataset &lt;- list(N=n, N_edges=n_edges, node1=nod1, node2=nod2, Y=y, X=x, Offset=e) The above information is going to be passed to Stan in the data block. Now, we are in the position to develop our spatial intrinsic conditional autoregressive (ICAR) model. Now open your Stan script and we begin. 5.4 Creating the script for the Spatial ICAR model 5.4.1 Data block In the data block, we specify the following: The total number of areal unit observations N as an integer (i.e., 307), this corresponds to n; The total number edges N_edges as an integer (i.e., 823), this corresponds to n_edges; The nodes1 based on the size of N_edges (i.e., 823) must be specified as an array to connect with nodes2, this corresponds to nod1; The nodes2 based on the size of N_edges (i.e., 823) must be specified as an array to connect with nodes1, this corresponds to nod2; We define our Y outcome (i.e., road accidents) as an array of size N (i.e., 307) which is an integer, this corresponds to y; We define our independent variables X as a vector of size N (i.e., 307), this corresponds to x; We must define our offset for the expected numbers Offset as a vector of size N (i.e., 307), this corresponds to e; Here is what our modeldata block` would look like: data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; // number of spatial units or neighbourhoods int&lt;lower=0&gt; N_edges; // number of edges connecting adjacent areas using Queens contiguity array[N_edges] int&lt;lower=1, upper=N&gt; node1; // list of index areas showing which spatial units are neighbours array[N_edges] int&lt;lower=1, upper=N&gt; node2; // list of neighbouring areas showing the connection to index spatial unit array[N] int&lt;lower=0&gt; Y; // dependent variable vector&lt;lower=0&gt;[N] X; // Single independent variable vector&lt;lower=0&gt;[N] Offset; // offset variable } 5.4.2 Transformed data block We are going to include a transformed data block. Here, we are simply changing the expected numbers by taking its log() and creating another vector called log_offset. This will be added to the poisson_log() sampling statement in our likelihood function of the spatial model to account for the reference population in England. Here, we specify it as follows: data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; // number of spatial units or neighbourhoods int&lt;lower=0&gt; N_edges; // number of edges connecting adjacent areas using Queens contiguity array[N_edges] int&lt;lower=1, upper=N&gt; node1; // list of index areas showing which spatial units are neighbours array[N_edges] int&lt;lower=1, upper=N&gt; node2; // list of neighbouring areas showing the connection to index spatial unit array[N] int&lt;lower=0&gt; Y; // dependent variable vector&lt;lower=0&gt;[N] X; // Single independent variable vector&lt;lower=0&gt;[N] Offset; // offset variable } transformed data { vector[N] log_Offset = log(Offset); // use the expected cases as an offset and add to the regression model } 5.4.3 Parameters block For the parameters block, we will need to specify the following: The global intercept i.e., alpha for the entire study area (i.e., average risk of road accidents on a population-level); The coefficient beta for our independent variable X which is the IMDScore; We also specify sigma as a real value which is some error or standard deviation that is multiplied to the combined effects of our structured and unstructured random effects; We define the structured spatial random effects phi to be vector of size N; We define the unstructured spatial random effects theta to be vector of size N; We define rho as the proportion of the variation coming from the structured spatial random effects; We add the parameters block as follows: data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; // number of spatial units or neighbourhoods int&lt;lower=0&gt; N_edges; // number of edges connecting adjacent areas using Queens contiguity array[N_edges] int&lt;lower=1, upper=N&gt; node1; // list of index areas showing which spatial units are neighbours array[N_edges] int&lt;lower=1, upper=N&gt; node2; // list of neighbouring areas showing the connection to index spatial unit array[N] int&lt;lower=0&gt; Y; // dependent variable vector&lt;lower=0&gt;[N] X; // Single independent variable vector&lt;lower=0&gt;[N] Offset; // offset variable } transformed data { vector[N] log_Offset = log(Offset); // use the expected cases as an offset and add to the regression model } parameters { real alpha; // intercept real beta; // covariates real&lt;lower=0&gt; sigma; // overall standard deviation real&lt;lower=0, upper=1&gt; rho; // proportion unstructured vs. spatially structured variance vector[N] theta; // unstructured random effects vector[N] phi; // structured spatial random effects } 5.4.4 Transformed parameters block Here, we calculate the combined random effects from the structured and unstructured component for our model: data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; // number of spatial units or neighbourhoods int&lt;lower=0&gt; N_edges; // number of edges connecting adjacent areas using Queens contiguity array[N_edges] int&lt;lower=1, upper=N&gt; node1; // list of index areas showing which spatial units are neighbours array[N_edges] int&lt;lower=1, upper=N&gt; node2; // list of neighbouring areas showing the connection to index spatial unit array[N] int&lt;lower=0&gt; Y; // dependent variable vector&lt;lower=0&gt;[N] X; // Single independent variable vector&lt;lower=0&gt;[N] Offset; // offset variable } transformed data { vector[N] log_Offset = log(Offset); // use the expected cases as an offset and add to the regression model } parameters { real alpha; // intercept real beta; // covariates real&lt;lower=0&gt; sigma; // overall standard deviation real&lt;lower=0, upper=1&gt; rho; // proportion unstructured vs. spatially structured variance vector[N] theta; // unstructured random effects vector[N] phi; // structured spatial random effects } transformed parameters { vector[N] combined; // values derived from adding the unstructure and structured effect of each area combined = sqrt(1 - rho) * theta + sqrt(rho) * phi; // formulation for the combined random effect } 5.4.5 Model block We build our likelihood function and specify the priors for each parameter under the model block. We are using a typical Poisson model with a log link function as we are assuming there’s some linear relationship between the road accident counts and IMD score, but here we are also taking into account the combined spatial and non-spatial random effects: data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; // number of spatial units or neighbourhoods int&lt;lower=0&gt; N_edges; // number of edges connecting adjacent areas using Queens contiguity array[N_edges] int&lt;lower=1, upper=N&gt; node1; // list of index areas showing which spatial units are neighbours array[N_edges] int&lt;lower=1, upper=N&gt; node2; // list of neighbouring areas showing the connection to index spatial unit array[N] int&lt;lower=0&gt; Y; // dependent variable vector&lt;lower=0&gt;[N] X; // Single independent variable vector&lt;lower=0&gt;[N] Offset; // offset variable } transformed data { vector[N] log_Offset = log(Offset); // use the expected cases as an offset and add to the regression model } parameters { real alpha; // intercept real beta; // covariates real&lt;lower=0&gt; sigma; // overall standard deviation real&lt;lower=0, upper=1&gt; rho; // proportion unstructured vs. spatially structured variance vector[N] theta; // unstructured random effects vector[N] phi; // structured spatial random effects } transformed parameters { vector[N] combined; // values derived from adding the unstructure and structured effect of each area combined = sqrt(1 - rho) * theta + sqrt(rho) * phi; // formulation for the combined random effect } model { Y ~ poisson_log(log_Offset + alpha + X * beta + combined * sigma); // likelihood function: multivariable Poisson ICAR regression model // setting priors alpha ~ normal(0.0, 1.0); // prior for alpha: weakly informative beta ~ normal(0.0, 1.0); // prior for betas: weakly informative theta ~ normal(0.0, 1.0); // prior for theta: weakly informative sigma ~ normal(0.0, 1.0); // prior for sigma: weakly informative rho ~ beta(0.5, 0.5); // prior for rho target += -0.5 * dot_self(phi[node1] - phi[node2]); // calculates the spatial weights sum(phi) ~ normal(0, 0.001 * N); // priors for phi } 5.4.6 Generated quantities block Lastly, we instruct Stan on the parameters we want to report. We want them as relative risk ratio (RR). We can use the generated quantities block to obtain these estimates by exponentiation of the ICAR regression model: data { int&lt;lower=0&gt; N; // number of spatial units or neighbourhoods int&lt;lower=0&gt; N_edges; // number of edges connecting adjacent areas using Queens contiguity array[N_edges] int&lt;lower=1, upper=N&gt; node1; // list of index areas showing which spatial units are neighbours array[N_edges] int&lt;lower=1, upper=N&gt; node2; // list of neighbouring areas showing the connection to index spatial unit array[N] int&lt;lower=0&gt; Y; // dependent variable vector&lt;lower=0&gt;[N] X; // Single independent variable vector&lt;lower=0&gt;[N] Offset; // offset variable } transformed data { vector[N] log_Offset = log(Offset); // use the expected cases as an offset and add to the regression model } parameters { real alpha; // intercept real beta; // covariates real&lt;lower=0&gt; sigma; // overall standard deviation real&lt;lower=0, upper=1&gt; rho; // proportion unstructured vs. spatially structured variance vector[N] theta; // unstructured random effects vector[N] phi; // structured spatial random effects } transformed parameters { vector[N] combined; // values derived from adding the unstructure and structured effect of each area combined = sqrt(1 - rho) * theta + sqrt(rho) * phi; // formulation for the combined random effect } model { Y ~ poisson_log(log_Offset + alpha + X * beta + combined * sigma); // likelihood function: multivariable Poisson ICAR regression model // setting priors alpha ~ normal(0.0, 1.0); // prior for alpha: weakly informative beta ~ normal(0.0, 1.0); // prior for betas: weakly informative theta ~ normal(0.0, 1.0); // prior for theta: weakly informative sigma ~ normal(0.0, 1.0); // prior for sigma: weakly informative rho ~ beta(0.5, 0.5); // prior for rho target += -0.5 * dot_self(phi[node1] - phi[node2]); // calculates the spatial weights sum(phi) ~ normal(0, 0.001 * N); // priors for phi } generated quantities { vector[N] eta = alpha + X * beta + combined * sigma; // compute eta and exponentiate into mu vector[N] rr_mu = exp(eta); // output the neighbourhood-specific relative risks in mu real rr_beta = exp(beta); // output the risk ratios for each coefficient real rr_alpha = exp(alpha); // output the risk ratios for the intercept } Well done! You have coded your first spatial risk model. Alright, let us save the script as icar_poisson_model.stan. We can now compile and run it through RStudio to get our posterior estimates as risk ratios (RR) for each areas. We can also get the exceedance probabilities. The next steps are easy from this point onwards. 5.5 Compiling Stan code for the Spatial ICAR risk modelling 5.5.1 Printing of the global results Now, let us turn our attention to RStudio. Using the stan() to compile the saved script to obtain the posterior estimation of the parameters from our model: icar_poisson_fit = stan(&quot;icar_poisson_model.stan&quot;, data=stan.spatial.dataset, iter=20000, control = list(max_treedepth = 12), chains=6, verbose = FALSE) We can see our estimated results for alpha, beta and sigma: # remove that annoying scientific notation options(scipen = 999) summary(icar_poisson_fit, pars=c(&quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;beta&quot;, &quot;sigma&quot;), probs=c(0.025, 0.975))$summary Output from summary()$summary function: mean se_mean sd 2.5% 97.5% n_eff Rhat alpha 0.162965832 0.00052694848 0.084071562 -0.001856892 0.32898381 25454.344 1.000094 beta -0.009775948 0.00002545072 0.004085887 -0.017779845 -0.00177424 25773.456 1.000076 sigma 0.627153399 0.00078449468 0.052970350 0.538581209 0.74606811 4559.169 1.001467 Here is the interpretation: alpha is the global mean (or average) in the population under study. It means on average the road accident occurrence in England for the period 2015 to 2020 is 0.1629 (95% CrI: -0.00185 to 0.3289). If we take the exponent of this value i.e., exp(0.162965832) - we get the relative risks of road accidents which is 1.17 times higher in England (95% CrI: 0.998 to 1.38). The result is not significant as the null value of 1 exists between its lower and upper limits. beta is the coefficient for IMDScore. This means that its yields a decrease on average for road accidents throughout England for more deprived areas -0.0097 (95% CI: -0.0177 to -0.00177424). This is negligible negative relationship that is statistically significant; while it is significant, if we exponentiate these values its really close to the null value (1), so we can rule out this relationship! sigma is the overall standard deviation or global error. Note, we can view the spatial effects i.e., phi for each area using this code: # show first 6 rows only instead of the full 307 head(summary(icar_poisson_fit, pars=c(&quot;phi&quot;), probs=c(0.025, 0.975))$summary) Alternatively, you can use the print() function to get a detailed output: print(icar_poisson_fit, pars=c(&quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;beta&quot;, &quot;sigma&quot;), probs=c(0.025, 0.975)) Output from print() function: Inference for Stan model: anon_model. 6 chains, each with iter=20000; warmup=10000; thin=1; post-warmup draws per chain=10000, total post-warmup draws=60000. mean se_mean sd 2.5% 97.5% n_eff Rhat alpha 0.16 0 0.08 0.00 0.33 25454 1 beta -0.01 0 0.00 -0.02 0.00 25773 1 sigma 0.63 0 0.05 0.54 0.75 4559 1 Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Fri Mar 8 07:41:39 2024. For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size, and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat=1). 5.5.2 Rapid diagnostics of the rHATs Before mapping the relative risks, we must check if the any of the estimates i.e., alpha, beta, sigma and all phi exceed the rHAT value of 1.05. This is an indication that the iterations did not perform well if an rHAT for a parameter is above 1.05. We can do a rapid checks to see which parameter is valid or not by creating a binary variable of 1’s (Valid) and 0’s (Not valid). We can tabulate it to see the numbers: # diagnostic check on the rHats - put everything into a data frame diagnostic.checks &lt;- as.data.frame(summary(icar_poisson_fit, pars=c(&quot;alpha&quot;, &quot;beta&quot;, &quot;sigma&quot;, &quot;phi&quot;, &quot;lp__&quot;), probs=c(0.025, 0.5, 0.975))$summary) # create binary variable diagnostic.checks$valid &lt;- ifelse(diagnostic.checks$Rhat &lt; 1.1, 1, 0) # tabulate it table(diagnostic.checks$valid) Everything is okay - all outputted parameters have an rHAT &lt; 1.05. We are free to generate our maps. NOTES: To avoid such complications, it is always to best to run about 10000, 15000 or more iterations. Usually, shorter iterations yield low effective sample sizes after thinning/warm-up samples are discarded, which in turn, may lead to complications that may cause the rHAT to be above 1.05. 5.5.3 Extraction of the area-specific relative risks If you run the following code: # show first 6 rows only instead of the full 307 head(summary(icar_poisson_fit, pars=c(&quot;rr_mu&quot;), probs=c(0.025, 0.975))$summary) We see the relative risk (RR) estimates for the first areas under the column mu with their corresponding credibility limits under the 2.5% and 97.5% column. We are going to extract this information into a data frame and applying the cleaning and renaming of columns accordingly: # extraction key posterior results for the generated quantities relativeRisk.results &lt;- as.data.frame(summary(icar_poisson_fit, pars=c(&quot;rr_mu&quot;), probs=c(0.025, 0.975))$summary) # now cleaning up this table up # first, insert clean row numbers to new data frame row.names(relativeRisk.results) &lt;- 1:nrow(relativeRisk.results) # second, rearrange the columns into order relativeRisk.results &lt;- relativeRisk.results[, c(1,4,5,7)] # third, rename the columns appropriately colnames(relativeRisk.results)[1] &lt;- &quot;rr&quot; colnames(relativeRisk.results)[2] &lt;- &quot;rrlower&quot; colnames(relativeRisk.results)[3] &lt;- &quot;rrupper&quot; colnames(relativeRisk.results)[4] &lt;- &quot;rHAT&quot; # view clean table head(relativeRisk.results) See clean table: rr rrlower rrupper rHAT valid 1 0.6295692 0.5759348 0.6859993 0.9999354 1 2 0.8043656 0.7550300 0.8555160 0.9999809 1 3 0.6518326 0.6068501 0.6991145 0.9999186 1 4 0.6292392 0.5920648 0.6674334 0.9999475 1 5 0.8885551 0.8284516 0.9505547 1.0000141 1 6 0.7971718 0.7451160 0.8513495 0.9999757 1 Insert these columns into the spatial.data object as follow: # now, we proceed to generate our risk maps # align the results to the areas in shapefile spatial.data$rr &lt;- relativeRisk.results[, &quot;rr&quot;] spatial.data$rrlower &lt;- relativeRisk.results[, &quot;rrlower&quot;] spatial.data$rrupper &lt;- relativeRisk.results[, &quot;rrupper&quot;] These relative will allow us to see the mapped risks of road accidents across local authorities in England. We also want a supporting map indicate whether the risks are significant or not. Here, we create an extra column in the spatial.data called Significance. # create categories to define if an area has significant increase or decrease in risk, or nothing all spatial.data$Significance &lt;- NA spatial.data$Significance[spatial.data$rrlower&lt;1 &amp; spatial.data$rrupper&gt;1] &lt;- 0 # NOT SIGNIFICANT spatial.data$Significance[spatial.data$rrlower==1 | spatial.data$rrupper==1] &lt;- 0 # NOT SIGNIFICANT spatial.data$Significance[spatial.data$rrlower&gt;1 &amp; spatial.data$rrupper&gt;1] &lt;- 1 # SIGNIFICANT INCREASE spatial.data$Significance[spatial.data$rrlower&lt;1 &amp; spatial.data$rrupper&lt;1] &lt;- -1 # SIGNIFICANT DECREASE 5.5.4 Mapping of RR and significance The next set of codes are all cosmetics for the creating our risk map for road accidents. Here is the code: # For map design for the relative risk -- you want to understand or get a handle on what the distribution for risks look like # this would inform you of how to create the labelling for the legends when make a map in tmap summary(spatial.data$rr) hist(spatial.data$rr) # creating the labels RiskCategorylist &lt;- c(&quot;&gt;0.0 to 0.25&quot;, &quot;0.26 to 0.50&quot;, &quot;0.51 to 0.75&quot;, &quot;0.76 to 0.99&quot;, &quot;1.00 &amp; &lt;1.01&quot;, &quot;1.01 to 1.10&quot;, &quot;1.11 to 1.25&quot;, &quot;1.26 to 1.50&quot;, &quot;1.51 to 1.75&quot;, &quot;1.76 to 2.00&quot;, &quot;2.01 to 3.00&quot;) # next, we are creating the discrete colour changes for my legends and want to use a divergent colour scheme # scheme ranges from extreme dark blues to light blues to white to light reds to extreme dark reds # you can pick your own colour choices by checking out this link [https://colorbrewer2.org] RRPalette &lt;- c(&quot;#65bafe&quot;,&quot;#98cffe&quot;,&quot;#cbe6fe&quot;,&quot;#dfeffe&quot;,&quot;white&quot;,&quot;#fed5d5&quot;,&quot;#fcbba1&quot;,&quot;#fc9272&quot;,&quot;#fb6a4a&quot;,&quot;#de2d26&quot;,&quot;#a50f15&quot;) # categorising the risk values to match the labelling in RiskCategorylist object spatial.data$RelativeRiskCat &lt;- NA spatial.data$RelativeRiskCat[spatial.data$rr&gt;= 0 &amp; spatial.data$rr &lt;= 0.25] &lt;- -4 spatial.data$RelativeRiskCat[spatial.data$rr&gt; 0.25 &amp; spatial.data$rr &lt;= 0.50] &lt;- -3 spatial.data$RelativeRiskCat[spatial.data$rr&gt; 0.50 &amp; spatial.data$rr &lt;= 0.75] &lt;- -2 spatial.data$RelativeRiskCat[spatial.data$rr&gt; 0.75 &amp; spatial.data$rr &lt; 1] &lt;- -1 spatial.data$RelativeRiskCat[spatial.data$rr&gt;= 1.00 &amp; spatial.data$rr &lt; 1.01] &lt;- 0 spatial.data$RelativeRiskCat[spatial.data$rr&gt;= 1.01 &amp; spatial.data$rr &lt;= 1.10] &lt;- 1 spatial.data$RelativeRiskCat[spatial.data$rr&gt; 1.10 &amp; spatial.data$rr &lt;= 1.25] &lt;- 2 spatial.data$RelativeRiskCat[spatial.data$rr&gt; 1.25 &amp; spatial.data$rr &lt;= 1.50] &lt;- 3 spatial.data$RelativeRiskCat[spatial.data$rr&gt; 1.50 &amp; spatial.data$rr &lt;= 1.75] &lt;- 4 spatial.data$RelativeRiskCat[spatial.data$rr&gt; 1.75 &amp; spatial.data$rr &lt;= 2.00] &lt;- 5 spatial.data$RelativeRiskCat[spatial.data$rr&gt; 2.00 &amp; spatial.data$rr &lt;= 10] &lt;- 6 # check to see if legend scheme is balanced - if a number is missing that categorisation is wrong! table(spatial.data$RelativeRiskCat) Generating the maps as a paneled output: # map of relative risk rr_map &lt;- tm_shape(spatial.data) + tm_fill(&quot;RelativeRiskCat&quot;, style = &quot;cat&quot;, title = &quot;Relavtive Risk&quot;, palette = RRPalette, labels = RiskCategorylist) + tm_shape(england_Region_shp) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0.05) + tm_text(&quot;name&quot;, size = &quot;AREA&quot;) + tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.outside = TRUE, legend.title.size = 0.8, legend.text.size = 0.7) + tm_compass(position = c(&quot;right&quot;, &quot;top&quot;)) + tm_scale_bar(position = c(&quot;right&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;)) # map of significance regions sg_map &lt;- tm_shape(spatial.data) + tm_fill(&quot;Significance&quot;, style = &quot;cat&quot;, title = &quot;Significance Categories&quot;, palette = c(&quot;#33a6fe&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, &quot;#fe0000&quot;), labels = c(&quot;Significantly low&quot;, &quot;Not Significant&quot;, &quot;Significantly high&quot;)) + tm_shape(england_Region_shp) + tm_polygons(alpha = 0.10) + tm_text(&quot;name&quot;, size = &quot;AREA&quot;) + tm_layout(frame = FALSE, legend.outside = TRUE, legend.title.size = 0.8, legend.text.size = 0.7) + tm_compass(position = c(&quot;right&quot;, &quot;top&quot;)) + tm_scale_bar(position = c(&quot;right&quot;, &quot;bottom&quot;)) # create side-by-side plot tmap_arrange(rr_map, sg_map, ncol = 2, nrow = 1) Output: 5.5.5 Extracting and mapping of the exceedance probabilities Exceedance probabilities allows the user to quantify the levels of uncertainty surrounding the risks we quantified. We can use a threshold for instance an RR &gt; 1 and ask what is the probability that an area has an excess risk of road accidents and visualise this as well. Just like the RRs, we are going to extract this information into a vector and include it into our spatial.data object. For this extraction, we will need to use functions from the tidybayes and tidyverse packages i.e., spread_draws(), group_by(), summarise() and pull(): # extract the exceedence probabilities from the icar_possion_fit object # compute the probability that an area has a relative risk ratio &gt; 1.0 threshold &lt;- function(x){mean(x &gt; 1.00)} excProbrr &lt;- icar_poisson_fit %&gt;% spread_draws(rr_mu[i]) %&gt;% group_by(i) %&gt;% summarise(rr_mu=threshold(rr_mu)) %&gt;% pull(rr_mu) # insert the exceedance values into the spatial data frame spatial.data$excProb &lt;- excProbrr The next set of codes are all cosmetics for the creating our probability exceedance map for road accidents.

While it is quite pronounced in all 10 regions in England, the burden is quite significant in South West region with large numbers of local authorities having an increased risk which are statistically significant. While, there’s significant limitation the models used here - perhaps, the Department for Transport should do an investigation on these patterns starting with the South West area. 5.6 Task Try your hand on this problem in Stan: Build a spatial ICAR model using data on counts of low birth weights in Georgia US to create the following maps: Map showing the relative risk of low birth weight across the 163 counties in Georgia Map showing the statistical significance of the relative risk Map showing the Exceedance Probabilities using the threshold of RR &gt; 1 Use the following dataset: Low_birth_weights_data.csv: Contains NAME, Lowbirths (Counts) and ExpectedNumber Georgia_Shapefile.shp: Contains NAME Try to complete this without consulting the solutions.
