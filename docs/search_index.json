This module has been designed as an advanced topics module to learn data science concepts and methods, and to apply them in the domains of social science and geography. The module will introduce concepts such as Bayesian inference and Machine Learning methodologies. Description This particular facet in the advanced topics course aims to cover an Introduction to Bayesian Inference in RStudio using Stan, which is an interface to RStudio that allows state-of-the-art statistical modelling and Bayesian computation. We will introduce you to the absolute basics of writing your own probabilistic codes for carrying out a broad range of multivariable regression models within the Bayesian framework: Generalised Linear Modelling (GLMs); Hierarchical Models; and most notably for Spatial Risk Models; and Spatiotemporal Risk Models and Bayesian Updating for prediction in risk assessment and uncertainties with exceedance probabilities, which all have significant applications to many fields such as spatial epidemiology, social sciences, or disaster risk reduction and many more. All lecture notes, recommended reading and seminar learning materials as well as supplementary video content will be hosted on this webpage. You can download the lecture notes and data sets for the practical lesson from the table below.
